This project aims to explore the practical applications of AI in medical diagnosis of breast cancer and diabetes using machine learning models, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods. The datasets used in this project were provided by the FIAP faculty and have been preprocessed and cleaned for accuracy and reliability.

To run this project, you will need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install Jupyter using pip or conda. Once Jupyter is installed, simply open the project's Jupyter notebook in your browser and follow the instructions provided.

The project includes two datasets: one for breast cancer and one for diabetes. Each dataset has been split into training and testing sets for machine learning model development.

The Jupyter notebook provided in this project includes the implementation of various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Linear Regression. Each implementation has been explained in detail with code and visualizations of the results and performance metrics for each model.

You can modify the code to experiment with different learning methods or parameters and see how they affect the results. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the practical applications of AI in medical diagnosis and inspire further research in this field.
