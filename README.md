This project aims to explore the practical applications of AI in the medical diagnosis of breast cancer and diabetes. The project utilizes datasets provided by the FIAP faculty, which have been preprocessed and cleaned for accuracy and reliability. The Jupyter notebooks included in this project demonstrate the implementation of various machine learning models, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods.

To run the project, you will need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install Jupyter using pip or conda. Once Jupyter is installed, simply open the project's Jupyter notebook in your browser and follow the instructions provided. The project includes two datasets: one for breast cancer and one for diabetes. Each dataset has been split into training and testing sets for machine learning model development.

The project's Jupyter notebooks provide detailed explanations of the code used to develop and train the machine learning models. The notebooks also include visualizations of the results and performance metrics for each model. You can modify the code to experiment with different learning methods or parameters and see how they affect the results.

We hope that this project will provide valuable insights into the practical applications of AI in medical diagnosis and inspire further research in this field.
